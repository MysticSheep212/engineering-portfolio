                <li>
                    Goal:
                    <p>The goal of this project was to build a hydraulic-powered ballista that can launch projectiles
                        with precision and force.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Process:
                    <p>The process involved researching hydraulic systems, designing the ballista, and assembling the
                        components. We conducted multiple tests to optimize performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Paperwork:
                    <p>Documentation included detailed schematics, a parts list, and a comprehensive project report.</p>

        <h3>Marble Run</h3>
        <div class="project-description">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Goal:
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create a course for a marble that took as much time aspossible to
                        complete.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Process:
                    <p>The process involved designing unique segments for the marble to run through, creating track to
                        tie them all together, and constructing the track. All while having it be able to be removed
                        from the board flawlessly. We also refined the course to ensure consistent operation.</p>
                </li>

                    Paperwork:
                    <p>Documentation included initial sketches, design drawings, a 3D drawing and a material list.</p>
